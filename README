Puppet Monit Module --

Module for configuring monit : -

Tested on Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 Squeeze and Ubuntu 10.4 LTS with Puppet 2.6.

Installation --

Clone this repo to a monit directory under your Puppet modules directory:

git clone git://github.com/abhishektomar/Puppet-Monit.git monit
If you don't have a Puppet Master you can create a manifest file based on the notes below and run Puppet in stand-alone mode providing the module directory you cloned this repo to:

puppet apply --modulepath=modules monit_test.pp

Usage--

To install and configure monit, include the module:

include monit

You can override defaults in the monit config by including the module with this special syntax:

    monit::monitrc { "/etc/monit/monitrc":
        rootfs => "/dev/sda1",
        fqdn => "prod.example.com",
        hostname => "example",
		mailserver => "smtp.example.com",
		username => "anything",
		password => "anythnig",
		datafs => "/dev/sdc"
        }

I have added following to monitor the ssh service --

    monit::ssh { "/etc/monit/conf.d/ssh.monit":
        sshdaemon => "ssh",
        ssh_port => 22,
        }
